## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

In a world full of scattered thoughts, messy notes, and inconsistent interfaces,  
most personal writing tools either overwhelm with features or underwhelm with design.  
Thereâ€™s a gap between **a clean writing space** and **a maintainable developer structure**.

Camellia provides:

- **Minimalist UI** â†’ Soft color palette, clean typography, smooth layout.

- **Easily Expandable** â†’ Add more features without breaking existing architecture.
